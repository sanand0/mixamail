Hi {% firstof handler.from_name handler.from_mail %},

You just mailed us. But we're not sure we've been introduced, so here goes: We're Mixamail.

Mixamail lets you access Twitter via e-mail. This is useful if you have e-mail but not Internet access (e.g. on your BlackBerry, or if Twitter is blocked).

First, you need to log in at http://www.mixamail.com and give {{ handler.from_mail }} access to your Twitter account. (Yes, this means you need to be able to access Twitter for the setup. Sorry.)

Once you're set up, you can read or update tweets from {{ handler.from_mail }}.

Enjoy!
Mixamail
