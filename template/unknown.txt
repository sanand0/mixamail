Hi {% firstof handler.from_name handler.from_mail %},

You just mailed us. But we're not sure we've been introduced, so here goes: We're Mixamail.

Mixamail lets you access Twitter via e-mail. This is useful if you have e-mail but not Internet access (e.g. on your BlackBerry).

You haven't yet logged in, but you can still search for public tweets. Mail twitter@mixamail.com with a subject "Search whatever-you-want". We'll reply with tweets mentioning whatever-you-want.

But if you log in at http://www.mixamail.com and give {{ handler.from_mail }} access to your Twitter account, you can read and update tweets too.

Enjoy!
Mixamail
