Hi {% firstof handler.from_name handler.from_mail %},

You just mailed us. But we're not sure we've been introduced, so here goes: We're Mixamail.

Mixamail lets you access Twitter via e-mail. This is useful if you have e-mail but not Internet access (e.g. on your BlackBerry).

You can update your status by mailing twitter@mixamail.com with a subject "Update". The body is your status. (We'll shorten links.)

You can search for any text by mailing twitter@mixamail.com with a subject "Search". The body is your search query.

You can read tweets by sending an e-mail to twitter@mixamail.com. (Any other subject, like "fetch" is fine.)

But first, you need to log in at http://www.mixamail.com and give {{ handler.from_mail }} access to your Twitter account.

Enjoy!
Mixamail
